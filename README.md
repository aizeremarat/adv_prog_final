**Automatic Number Plate Recognition System**

This project aims to provide a comprehensive Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) solution utilizing computer vision and machine learning techniques. The system is capable of accurately detecting and recognizing license plates from images and video streams.

**Requirements:**

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (cv2)
- Pytesseract
- Regular expressions (re)
- EasyOCR
- Tesseract OCR

**Installation:**

1. Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system.
2. Install the required libraries by running: pip install opencv-python pytesseract easyocr
3. Install Tesseract OCR. You can download it from [Tesseract-OCR GitHub](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract).
4. Update the Tesseract path in the code (`pytesseract.pytesseract.tesseract_cmd`) to match your installation directory.

**Usage:**

1. Clone this repository or download the project files.
2. Import the required libraries:
```python
import cv2 pytesseract re os easyocr
